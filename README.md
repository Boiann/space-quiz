## **Project Overview**
The idea of developing space-themed quiz was in author's mind for a long time, since starting the Code Institute Full-stack development program.
As soon as the Python lessons were finished, the author knew that space themed quiz will be developed if able. After research the wireframes and the flowchart were developed and the project fully made-up conceptually.
The idea to dedicate the project came after first quote from Mr. Sagan was inserted.
The quiz-based game explains itself but there are numerous features that (hopefully) set it apart:
 - Error checking throughout the quiz
 - Feedback on every input ( right or wrong )
 - Evenly and nicely spaced text
 - Text output in typewriter style
 - Interesting secret hidden within the quiz
 - Ability to know more about question/answer, no matter if question is answered right or wrong 
 - Get a hint, sometimes rather funny
 - Get your name on leaderboard
 - Restart the quiz without using mouse and keep your username if you want
 - Enjoy simple and relaxing space-themed webpage

### **Project Goals**
 - Develop CLI based quiz game using Python
 - Present the quiz in a clean and easy to understand manner
 - Keep good UX principles regarding layout/colours/interaction
 - Robust Python code without issues/bugs
