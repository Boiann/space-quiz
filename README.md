# SPACE-QUIZ

SPACE-Quiz is a Project 3 for Code Institute Full-stack development program: Python Essentials.
Made with passion for anyone interested in space, astronomy and anything related to it.
The whole project is dedicated to Mr. Carl Sagan, whose books, TV shows and science communication continues to inspire today.

## **Project Overview**
The idea of developing space-themed quiz was in author's mind for a long time, since starting the Code Institute Full-stack development program.
As soon as the Python lessons were finished, the author knew that space themed quiz will be developed if able. After research the wireframes and the flowchart were developed and the project fully made-up conceptually.
The idea to dedicate the project came after first quote from Mr. Sagan was inserted.
The quiz-based game explains itself but there are numerous features that (hopefully) set it apart:
 - Error checking throughout the quiz
 - Feedback on every input ( right or wrong )
 - Evenly and nicely spaced text
 - Text output in typewriter style
 - Interesting secret hidden within the quiz
 - Ability to know more about question/answer, no matter if question is answered right or wrong 
 - Get a hint, sometimes rather funny
 - Get your name on leaderboard
 - Restart the quiz without using mouse and keep your username if you want
 - Enjoy simple and relaxing space-themed webpage

### **Project Goals**
 - Develop CLI based quiz game using Python
 - Present the quiz in a clean and easy to understand manner
 - Keep good UX principles regarding layout/colours/interaction
 - Robust Python code without issues/bugs

## **User Experience**

### **User Expectations**
 - Able to quickly understand what the purpose of the site is
 - Find additional info/rules if needed
 - Every interaction has feedback
 - Get a hint if stuck
 - Get more info about question/answer, right or wrong 
 - Get name on/see the leaderboard
 - Good looking and theme adjusted look of the project
 - No errors with the game logic

### **User Stories**

I want to know what is this site for
I want to find additional info/instructions
I want to have numbers in my username
I want to know more about the answer I got wrong
I want to restart the quiz and keep my username
I want no bugs or issues with the game

## **Design**

### **Colour Scheme**

<!-- Colour Palette image -->

There are just a few colors used in the CLI, by installing/importing TERMCOLOR and CPRINT. The red colored text signifies wrong answer/input, green is used for the right answer, light cyan for leaderboard, guide and more knowledge display. The blue is used for intro/outro quote and quiz logo/intro.
Aside for CLI itself, on the webpage the colors used are blue for quiz title and its variations for hover color change on the 'run program' button.
This was not mandatory but the author felt necessary to include simple but nice colours to pair with the project theme.

### **Imagery**

<!-- Stars GIF -->
<!-- Favicon -->

Only two images (image and GIF) were used for the project. The Interstellar Dream GIF was obtained from Youtube [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh816wRR2hc&list=PLNZfrta02FkM15KMNlB24dDz68EPa22lD&index=27&ab_channel=AllBackgroundVideos "Link to Youtube"). The author used [GifCap](https://gifcap.dev/ "Link to GifCap page") to capture the GIF, then [XConvert](https://www.xconvert.com/compress-gif "Link to GifCap page") to resize and compress the GIF.
The GIF's purpose is to make the UX better and add something dynamic outside the CLI. 
The other image used is favicon 'galaxy' which pairs nicely with the project.
