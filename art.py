        "The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff.
           We are a way for the universe to know itself."
                         -CARL SAGAN-

        "We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions
         and the depth of our answers, our willingness to embrace
              what is true rather than what feels good."
                            -CARL SAGAN-
